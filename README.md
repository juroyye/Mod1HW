Approach to the Space Text Adventure Game:

 Step 1: Construct the divs, UI, and overall structure of the program.
 
 Step 2: Research how I am going to hide text inside of options (so that when I select an option, I am presented with a path of other options.) I've decided to hardcode everything, and attempt to create a entirely new instance everytime I click the button.
 I'm going to create different categories, each function is going to be tied to a specific prompt.
  I'm now weighing the pros and cons of utilizing multiple if statements vs multiple functions.

  I need to transform the text of the container, value of each of the buttons when a button is selected, and also set the button up for the next time it is clicked.
I am going to create well over the amount of boxes I need and create a function that only displays the boxes with text inside.

CREATE DELETING/DISAPPEARING BOXES FUNCTION NEXT, TEST TO SEE IF IT WORKS.
IF SO, CREATE MORE BOXES, ASSIGN VALUES, AND MAKE FINISHING TOUCHES.
