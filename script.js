           to intercept. Pushing the throttle harder than you ever have before and pulling 
           the trigger, you feel the miniguns rumble as they pre-fire at the estimated 
           coordinates of the enemy craft. Three direct hits, and the enemy ship immediately explodes 
           into a fiery ball. Relieved, you slow the ship down in search of the next target.
           Before you see it, however, Scarr's ship itself scorches past you, deploying a 
           space mine that immediately clings to the bottom of your ship. Before you have time 
           to react, it detonates. You and your vessel are erased forever.

               to life as you set off for the gate, dodging multiple explosions and searing energy 
               shards that are cast through through the battlefield. An enemy attempts to intercept 
               you, but is hastily shot down by a police crusader. You perform barrel roll after 
               barrel roll, tilting your wings to avoid debris and swirling to avoid thermal 
               missiles fired with you as the target. Your luck expires, however, and while you are 
               in proximity of the hypergate, you are struck by a bolt through the right wing. 
               Your ship spirals as you struggle to regain control, in which you nearly collide
               with a cracked in half police vessel. Upon activating the auxiliary thrusters, you 
               stabilize the vessel and jettison to the gate. Rumbling through, you immediately shut the
               lights off to conserve power and plot your next move. Almost instantly after,
               Lord Scarr follows through with his cannons already charged. His groggy and distorted 
               voice comes across your comms with a chilling yet simple message. "Pass the tesseract."
               Once again, you're faced with a critical decision that will affect trillions of lives.`;
